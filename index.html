                        <p class="lead">I'm an <b class="fw-bold">independent game developer</b> who specializes in <b class="fw-bold">programming</b>, <b class="fw-bold">gameplay design</b> and <b class="fw-bold">level design</b>. I also <b class="fw-bold">work as a freelancer</b> for various clients. No matter if it is a person who has a wonderful game idea in mind, an independent studio who could use an extra hand or a startup studio who wants a talented developer to join the team for the project.</p>
                        <p class="lead">I graduated from University of Technology Sydney in Bachelor of Science in Game Development. I have plenty of experience in making a wide variety of games. From the easier ones such as platformers or point and click games to the more complicated ones such as strategy or action games. I enjoy making all different types of games.</p>
                        <p class="lead">As a game development contractor, I value my relationship with my clients. Therefore I always try to deliver the best product. For that, I prioritize communication to ensure the product matches the vision in the client's mind perfectly if not better.</p>
                        <p class="lead">If you have a project and would like an extra hand. Please don't hesitate to send an email to <b class="fw-bold"> solthunder93@gmail.com </b>. I'm looking forward to working with you for an amazing project!!</p>

                        <p class="lead">Working as a programmer, I pay a lot of attention to my code to ensure consistency, readability and efficiency. During the coding process, I consider not only the functionality that I'm working on, but also others that may interact with the script. So that the structure of the project would be more consistent and easier to work with, modify or expand in the future. In the end, it will benefit the efficiency and the quality of the development.</p>
                        <p class="lead">While designing gameplay, based on my ability on programming. I could explain the parameters that I needed in the designing process clearly. This helps programmers to clarify the details of their code. I pay attention to small details in designing and focus on player experience. I believe there is no absolute answer in designing. But the goal would be to deliver a gameplay experience to player that matches what the developer wants the player to experience.</p>
                        <p class="lead">In level design, I have experience designing levels for platformers, action games and puzzle games. I found the process can be very systematic. Level sections can be built upon the ideas, skills or techniques that the level features. Which can be adjusted and connected afterward. In level design, I also pay attention to the environment. In order to deliver the setting and story through the level.</p>

                                            “Do A Barrel Roll??” is a “Getting over it” type of platformer developed via Unity Engine. It introduces a unique control method of character and challenging level design with a punishing penalty when making a mistake. This project was developed solo in 9 months with a minimum of downloaded assets.  All game scripts, tiles, UI elements, main menu background, barrel sprite and pirate ship sprite are created by myself.

                                                During development, I found that the emoji movement requires some complicated physics calculations. At first, I defined realistic physics from scratch. However, the movement was boring. So, I make the emoji movement controlled by two different methods where the effectiveness of the methods change depending on the barrel's angular velocity. As a result, the movement of emoji becomes ridiculous and funny but at the same time, still realistic enough.
                                            </p>

                                                On the other hand, there is a bug where the character sometimes gets stuck inside the tilemap when high in velocity. Sometimes, Unity's physics engine itself is enough to save the situation. However, it is far from consistent. Therefore, I try to move the character to the opposite direction of its velocity to free it when it gets stuck in more than one frame. As the engine may fix it itself. As a result, the bug never showed again. Providing a smooth gameplay experience to the player.

                                                I tend to design the gameplay to a very detailed level. But the downside is, it requires a large number of parameters. As a result, the goal of design becomes very vague. To address this, I created a few situations that need to be satisfied. And the goal would be finding a parameter set that satisfies all the situations. For example, in this game, I want the player to climb a 3 by 1 slope with the requirement of drawing 1-2 circles per second so that it is very possible but requires a little bit of effort. At the same time, after falling from a 1 by 3 slope I want the player to be able to stop in 3 - 4 flat tiles length so that player has to really try and always worry of not stopping in time. At the end, after many trials of play testing, I found the parameter set to satisfy both situations and fit the goal of my gameplay design.

                                                Regarding this type of game, I always think that the player can't do anything after a mistake is unfair. The different outcome only depends on the position of the mistake being made. Therefore, I want to design the level so that after making a mistake. Though some progress will be lost but the amount of progress loss depends on players actions. However, it is very difficult to design such levels. So I first sketch the platforming idea part of the section. Then link the section to the previous section and consider the potential failure and their outcome. Next, add appropriate potential save to the previous section or the current section. Lastly, repeat between play testing the level and fine tuning the level until I am satisfied with the result. At the end, I provide a challenging and sometimes frustrating but always fair experience to the players.

                                            “Elementalist” is a mouse only arcade game developed with Unity Engine during ScoreSpace Jam#26. In this game, players play as a mage who collects elemental spirits to perform spells to defeat enemies. Players would click on the spirits that flew around the screen to collect them. Then drag the collected spirits to the enemy to cast spells. According to the number and types of spirits the player has collected, different unique spells can be casted.

                                                During the development. Determining which spells are cast by the collected spirit was a challenge. The most straightforward way would be checking every spell with every collected spirit for each element. However, this is terrible in time efficiency with O(n^2).Therefore, I came up with two other solutions.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                The first one is having an array of 4 integers. As the number of collected spirits for each element. Then loop through the spell list  and check for spell cost. This achieves a time efficiency O(n) implementation with an array of 4 integers added into the memory. 
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                The second solution is having a 4 dimension array as a spell list. Each slot of the array would be null or a spell item. Then again, having an array of 4 integers to count the collected spirits. So that, when a player casts the spell, I just need to find the item in the spell list with a time efficiency of O(1). However, the highest cost spell cost 4 spirits of each element. Therefore, a minimum of 256 slots will be allocated in the spell list. Which takes some memory. 
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                In the end, I chose the first solution. As a game for game jam, I did not prepare a lot of spells i.e. 14 spells. Therefore, the majority in the spell list from the second solution would be empty. Which is not worth doing. In addition, for the same reason, in the worst case, n would only be 14 in the first solution. Although the second solution is convenient to show the spell player can be cast with current collected spirits. However, as a game plan for a WebGL build, I do not want to take too much memory. Therefore, the first solution is more suitable for this situation.

                                                During the design process of this game, there are a few aspects that I try to achieve. Those are rewarding resources management, minimum downtime boredom and providing game progression.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                To reward players that manage the spirits on screen well, there is an elemental weakness system. The enemy has an elemental type. As well as the 4 spells that cost 2 of the same element. Which deals 150%, 100%, 50% and 0% damage respectively regarding enemy elemental type. In this case, the most optimal strategy would be to always focus on enemy weaknesses. However, the spirit on the screen may not always be ideal. Therefore, there are also two spells that cost 3 spirit which alway deal 100% damage. Furthermore, spells with 3 or 4 different types of spirit would spawn 3 or in the latter case, 5 onto the screen. As a result, players have more control over the battle and minimize the effect of luck to achieve rewarding game play.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Secondly, if there is no downtime for the player, it may be too chaotic and stressful for the player. However, if there is too much downtime without anything to do, it also affects the fluency of the game play. To address that, enabling the player to swap around the spirit is just perfect for the downtime. During the down time, the enemy is still waiting to be spawned. At that time, no stress would be added onto the player. But the player can manage around the spirit, increasing their advantage for the next fight. Therefore, providing a resting time without causing boredom of the player.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Lastly, I would like to provide a sense of progression to the player, even if this is a small arcade game. As a result, spells are designed to be unlocked in the library after the player has casted the spell once. Enable players to improve by learning more knowledge of the spells and providing a discovery kind of game play experience.

                                            “3 Second Commander” is a strategy game developed with Unity Engine during icoJam2023. In this game, the player plays as a commander of an army with up to 4 soldiers. Players can only give instructions to their soldier during the control phase with a timer counting 3, 2, and 1. After the control phase, all the soldiers will take action following the instructions the player had given. Pawns from both sides will be instructed and action at the same time. So, players have to predict their enemies actions to achieve victory.

                                                Since this game is developed during a game jam, we have very limited time. However, the game idea required enemy AI or multiplayer implementation to work. In which, either of them takes a long time to code, considering we only have 2 days for the game jam. During the game jam, we decided to stick with AI instead of multiplayer considering it is a game jam setting. After the game jam, enemy AI is reworked and multiplayer is implemented.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Before the implementation of the enemy AI, I need to design the architecture of the AI system. For the enemy AI of this game, the requirements are being able to observe the battlefield, including alli and enemy then decide an action of the pawn. Since the AI would need to observe the battlefield from the start for every turn. Therefore, it should be a behaviour tree like structure. However, it is different to a traditional behaviour tree. There will not be a processing return value since the end result is a decision for the turn. It will only return successful or failure, in which returning failure means error occurred. Additionally, an AI like this would need some randomness to be more unpredictable. Plus I also want them to behave like a team. Therefore, an offensiveness variable is added to the AI for each turn. It is determined by level of advantages i.e. number difference of pawns and a random generated number. Some nodes in the tree would return false when the offensiveness is too high or too low.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Implementing enemy AI, I first take note of all the possible actions i.e. end nodes of all three types of pawns would take. Then, take note of all the possible checks i.e. branch nodes. Next, sketch the diagram for all three types of pawns AI. Lastly, simply follow the diagram, and implement their AI. I found this workflow very efficient and free of mistakes. As a result, the first version of the enemy AI system managed to be finished before the game jam deadline.
                                            </p>

                                                On the other hand, multiplayer was being implemented after the game jam. In this project, multiplayer is implemented through unity netcode package. However, I did not use the built-in synchronisation functionality although it may decrease some work load. There are a few reasons. First, I would like the player pawns alway start at the same side, increasing the consistency and decreasing confusion. Second, pawns will only move in the action phase. Sending packages between players constantly is redundant. Therefore, I decide to only send packages when needed. At the start of the game, players would send their pawn setup to the server. When the server receives the setup from both players, the game will be started. In addition, pawn moves will be sent to the server at the end of the control phase. Again, once the server receives pawn moves from both players, the server will send back the pawn actions from both players to both players. Lastly, the moves will be translated and inputted into the enemy pawns locally. Performing the same movement to both sides, just mirrored.

                                                During the designing process of this game, I would like the 3 classes to counter each other like rock paper scissors. However, the advantage of the counter relationship should not be too significant. As strategy and prediction should be the most important component in the game play. Therefore, my aim is to design an advantage for each class against the counter class. But still able to turn the table if the prediction of the player is correct and precise.

                                            <p>
                                                Regarding the relationship between archer and knight, archers move distances further than knight. So, an archer can kite the knight. However, archers would need to reload after an attack which it cannot move when reloading. Therefore, despite the advantage to the archers, knights can win against archers if they can catch archers during the reload.

                                            <p>
                                                As for the relationship between knight and scout, knights have significantly higher health than scout, plus, if knight blocks an scout attack, scout cannot damage another pawn with the same attack. Knight can win scouts by trading hits easily. However, if scouts are able to catch the knight off guard and attack from behind, it is possible that a scout will defeat the knight.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Finally, the relationship between scout and archer, as scouts can move very far. They can punish a reloading archer easily. However, since archers, especially a reloading one, are such a good target for scouts. The action of the scout can be easily predicted and punished by another pawn.
